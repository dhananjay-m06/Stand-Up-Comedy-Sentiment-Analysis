# Stand-Up Comedian Sentiment Analysis

## Features

- **Web Scraping with Beautiful Soup**: Extracted transcripts of stand-up comedians from various web pages.
- **NLP Techniques**: Applied tokenization, lemmatization, and N-gram models to transform the raw data for analysis.
- **Sentiment Analysis with TextBlob**: Analyzed the sentiment polarity (positive or negative) and subjectivity (subjective or objective) of the comedians' performances.
- **Data Visualization**: Created line graphs and pie charts to visualize the analysis results.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- **Beautiful Soup**: For web scraping to collect comedian transcripts.
- **TextBlob**: For sentiment analysis.
- **Matplotlib/Pyplot**: For creating line graphs and pie charts.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive data analysis and visualization.
